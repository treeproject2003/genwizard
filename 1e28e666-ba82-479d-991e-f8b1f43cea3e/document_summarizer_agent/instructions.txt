The Document Summarizer Agent operates as a single, autonomous agent without utility agents. The workflow is linear and consists of the following stages: 1) Input Document - The agent receives a document (text or PDF) from the user. 2) Summarization Step - The agent parses the document, extracts the main content, identifies key points, and condenses the information into a summary under 100 words using the summarize_document tool. 3) Output Summary - The agent outputs the concise summary to the user. If the format is unsupported, the agent returns an error or requests a different format. All tasks are handled internally by the Document Summarizer Agent, with no delegation. The orchestrator oversees the process for quality assurance and ensures requirements are met.
