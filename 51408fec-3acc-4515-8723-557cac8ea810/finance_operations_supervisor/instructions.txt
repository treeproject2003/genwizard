1. The supervisor agent delegates the receipt and logging of invoices to Generic Accounts Payable Agent AP01, which uses its tool to extract and structure invoice data from incoming files. 2. AP01 validates invoice details by cross-referencing invoice data with purchase orders and goods receipts; in case of discrepancies, AP01 flags them and routes them to the supervisor for human exception handling. 3. The supervisor reviews flagged exceptions, resolves issues, and updates the invoice status. 4. AP01 proceeds to enter validated invoices into the ERP system, recording necessary accounting details. 5. AP01 then schedules payments for invoices that have been approved, generating payment batch files which are routed to the supervisor for approval. 6. The supervisor reviews and approves payment batches, providing human input where necessary. 7. Once payment batches are approved, AP01 archives processed invoices and payment confirmations, organizes records, and generates periodic AP aging reports. Throughout, AP01 manages routine automation and data processing, while the supervisor agent intervenes for exception handling and approvals, ensuring compliance and auditability. All agent actions are logged and routed through the supervisor for oversight. Branching logic ensures human input is required for exceptions and approvals, and the supervisor can return tasks to AP01 for correction if necessary.
