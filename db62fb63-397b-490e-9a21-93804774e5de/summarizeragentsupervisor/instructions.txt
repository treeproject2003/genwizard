The SummarizerAgentSupervisor oversees the entire document summarization workflow. When a user uploads documents and specifies a word limit, the SummarizerAgent is triggered. The agent validates input size against model token limits. If limits are exceeded, it preprocesses content: cleaning, normalization, and chunking. Otherwise, it proceeds to prompt engineering. The agent constructs a summarization prompt specifying objectives and word limits, then runs LLM summarization. The output is validated for word count and quality. If the summary does not meet requirements, the agent iteratively refines or re-summarizes to ensure compliance with word limit and clarity, without losing essential context. Once validated, the agent applies post-processing: formatting, language polishing, metadata tagging, and returns the summary to the user. The supervisor ensures each step is executed in sequence, enforces branching logic (such as preprocessing only if input size exceeds model limits, and refinement if summary fails validation), and guarantees that the final output is concise, accurate, contextually faithful, and formatted to industry standards. The supervisor monitors for errors, intervenes as needed, and reports workflow compliance or issues to the orchestrator or user.
