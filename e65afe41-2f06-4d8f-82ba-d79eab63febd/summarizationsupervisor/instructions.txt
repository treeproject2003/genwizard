The workflow is linear and handled entirely by the Summarizer Agent under the supervision of SummarizationSupervisor. The process is as follows: 1. User submits arbitrary input text for summarization. SummarizationSupervisor receives the request and delegates it to Summarizer Agent. 2. Summarizer Agent processes the input by analyzing the text, extracting key points, removing redundant or less relevant information, and generating a summary not exceeding 100 words. 3. Summarizer Agent returns the summary to SummarizationSupervisor. 4. SummarizationSupervisor checks the summary for conciseness, coherence, and context preservation. If requirements are met, the summary is returned to the user. If not, feedback is provided and the summarization is repeated. There are no branching decision points; all summarization tasks follow this sequence. All delegation is direct from supervisor to Summarizer Agent, and all output is returned through the supervisor for quality assurance.
